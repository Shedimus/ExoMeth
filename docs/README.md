# ExoMeth

This repository is an accompaniment to the ExoMeth manuscript published in _to be confirmed_, titled "Developing a multivariable risk model integrating urinary cell DNA methylation & cell-free RNA data for the detection of significant prostate cancer".

All code required to **quantitatively** reproduce the analyses presented can be found here, including the RMarkdown file to produce the final formatted manuscript as submitted for peer review. 

### Getting Started

Multiple options exist for those interested in reproducing and investigating these analyses. 

For those simply wanting to reproduce the analysis within their own environments this repo can be cloned, all dependencies installed and the final document rendered by sourcing [Render_Manuscript.R](https://github.com/Shedimus/ExoMeth/blob/master/scripts/Render_Manuscript.R).

For those wanting a less in-depth approach this project has been set up within a Binder environnment that can be spun up **here**, requiring no dependencies to be installed on your machine.
